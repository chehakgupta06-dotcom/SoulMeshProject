## Problem Statement
Modern businesses suffer from soaring acquisition costs (CAC) due to fragmented Web2 and Web3 data and invasive data brokers. Soulmesh solves this by fusing identity, privacy, and data monetization into one ecosystem. DigiSoul leverages SBT-based credentials and zero-knowledge proofs to unify user data, while Corpus offers a privacy-preserving data marketplace for qualified leads. This dramatically reduces CAC, ensures compliance, and fosters trust, making Soulmesh indispensable for any enterprise navigating today’s digital landscape.

## <img src="./DigisoulDashboard/Misc/blk.gif" width=60 height=60> Introduction

DigiSoul is a two-layer zero-knowledge (ZK) identity platform that merges Web2 and Web3 data into a single, privacy-preserving dashboard. Users hold a SoulPass, backed by SBTs (Soulbound Tokens), which aggregate credentials such as credit scores, employment history, on-chain activity, and more—all verified through ZK proofs. The system employs a two-layer RSA-based ZKP: first, to confirm that a user’s public key is part of an authorized set (via a Merkle proof), and second, to verify their signature without revealing any private information.

Meanwhile, Corpus extends the ecosystem as a data marketplace where businesses can tap into privacy-preserving, user-approved insights from DigiSoul. Users selectively monetize verified attributes—such as high-level creditworthiness or professional credentials—while machine perception algorithms and AI models benefit from authentic, high-quality data. By bridging verified identity (DigiSoul) with scalable data exchange (Corpus), this platform empowers ethical data monetization and advanced analytic without sacrificing user privacy or trust.
